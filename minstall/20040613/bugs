- Testcase 11.4.2004 (latest MMOS/2 installation)
  Bug was in actual installation. Incorrect group was set on specified files.
  Anyway, correction got applied to mmi_basescr.c - setting GroupPtr for files
  specified as INI or config script in group-specification (control.scr) to
  actual group (original groupptr from files.scr-allocation is overwritten)
  This will fix the problem although the bug is in the installation-script.
- Fixed processing of cardinfo.dll and custom scripts. Now cardinfo.dll is
  processed AT FIRST and the custom scripts afterwards. That way cards that
  are generated by cardinfo and modified by custom scripts is possible.
  I'm not sure about original minstall behaviour though.
- Testcase 14.5.2004
  No error message was displayed, when GENIN.DLL got used but no cardinfo.dll
  was found. This was just confusing (no real bug).
- 5.6.2004
  Problem was in "REPLACEMENT" method for config-control-files. We didn't add
  ';' to the end of a path (if taken from DestPaths) and that is done by
  minstall. It seems that some applications require this weird behaviour.
- 13.6.2004
  GENIN.DLL has undocumented feature. ssdllinputparms may also contain a DLL
  name, that will get used instead of stanard "cardinfo.dll". Previously we
  processed cardinfo.dll as hardcoded DLL.
