                         Martin Kiewitz's vCOMPAT v0.34b
                        =================================

                             Released on 13.09.2005

                        Written and (c) by Martin Kiewitz

  ============
  | FOREWORD |
  ============

        OS/2 / eComStation's VDM is nearly perfectly emulating a real DOS
         session. Did I say nearly? Yes, I did.

        Some programs are too restrictive in their use of DOS APIs.
         And some MDOS-APIs do not behave 100% like in real DOS. Additionally
         some programs contain library bugs, so they won't run on faster
         machines even under real DOS (like e.g. Turbo Pascal CRT Unit bug).

        That's why I did this compatibility VDD. It hooks itself into the
         middle of several APIs and it contains a magical VM patcher, that is
         able to patch out some buggy routines on-the-fly, which means the user
         won't even notice that he got a broken program.

        vCOMPAT also contains code to patch out bugs in DPMI based (eg DOS4GW)
         games, so that they will run under OS/2 / eCS. This code is not
         absolutely failsafe and it *could* make a DPMI application crash, so
         if you experience a crash try to disable this feature. If you are
         using a DPMI application that is already working as expected, don't
         switch this feature on.

        vCOMPAT now also contains code, that will fix Sierra On-Line games.
         This will only work, when vSOUND is also loaded - and that prior to
         vCOMPAT. vSOUND will then send out notifications to vCOMPAT.

  ========================
  | vCOMPAT INSTALLATION |
  ========================

        Simply copy VCOMPAT.SYS into your MDOS directory (e.g. x:\OS2\MDOS)
         and insert this line into config.sys:
         'DEVICE=x:\OS2\MDOS\VCOMPAT.SYS'
         (where x:\ is your OS/2 / eCS boot-drive)

        It would be wise to insert the line after all other VDDs. If you are
         using vSOUND or the vCDROM replacement, you MUST specify vCOMPAT below
         those two drivers in config.sys!

  ======================
  | vCOMPAT PROPERTIES |
  ======================

        COMPATIBILITY_2GBSIZELIMIT (default ON):
       ------------------------------------------
         If enabled, vCOMPAT will fake total and free disk space to a maximum
          of 2 GB. Some DOS applications get confused, when DOS reports more,
          especially some software installers.

        COMPATIBILITY_CDROM (default ON):
       -----------------------------------
         If enabled, vCOMPAT will fix the behaviour of the CD-Extension APIs.
          This includes various fixes for CD-Audio, generic behaviour and some
          other CD-ROM specific things.

         vCOMPAT will automatically detect the new vCDROM replacement, disable
          this property then and automatically load one fix for IFS only.
          Everything else is already handled by the replacement.

        COMPATIBILITY_DPMI (default ON):
       ----------------------------------
         If enabled, vCOMPAT will include work-arounds for DPMI applications.
          If Magical VM Patcher is activated as well, bugs in DPMI applications
          will get removed as well (this doesn't include bad CLI code).

        COMPATIBILITY_DPMI_ANTICLI (default OFF):
       -------------------------------------------
         If enabled, Magical VM Patcher will also react on bad CLI-code and
          remove it on-the-fly. This will fix many, many games. Theoretically
          it could break applications, so don't activate until you need it.
          This property requires COMPATIBILITY_DPMI to be ON.

        COMPATIBILITY_GOSIERRA (default ON):
       --------------------------------------
         If enabled, Magical VM Patcher will react on Sierra On-Line sound
          driver bugs and remove them on-the-fly. This should fix almost any
          Sierra real-mode games.

         This property will only work, when vSOUND is loaded as well!

        COMPATIBILITY_JOYSTICKBIOS (default OFF):
       -------------------------------------------
         If enabled, vCOMPAT will handle any calls to Joystick BIOS APIs.
          Normally OS/2 would forward this call to the real BIOS.

        COMPATIBILITY_MOUSENSE (default OFF):
       ---------------------------------------
         If enabled, vCOMPAT will make the mouse more sensitive. This feature
          is only meant for some specific games and shouldn't be active at any
          other time.

        COMPATIBILITY_MAGICVMPATCHER (default AUTOMATIC):
       ---------------------------------------------------
         Possible selections
         AUTOMATIC - VM Patcher will automatically patch out bugs in programs
                      No notification will be made to the user
         ENABLED   - VM Patcher will detect bugs and generate a PopUp
                      accordingly. Choose ignore in that PopUp dialog to skip
                      patching
         DISABLED  - VM Patcher is 100% deactivated

         DPMI applications will only get analysed, when COMPATIBILITY_DPMI is
          set to ON as well.

         Currently the following bugs will get patched out:
          - Turbo Pascal CRT Unit Run-Time error 200 bug
             (Realmode and DPMI support!)
          - M$ C Library "Division by Zero" bug
             (encountered in some classic Lucas Arts games)
          - Clipper Timer-Unit bug
          - Sierra On-Line sounddriver bugs ("GOSIERRAv3" functionality)
             COMPATIBILITY_GOSIERRA must be enabled and vSOUND must be loaded!

  ====================
  | vCOMPAT Anti-CLI |
  ====================

         This code will fix at least the following games:
          - Alien Legacy (only with OS/2 eCS Nov 2002 or later kernel)
          - Boppin'
          - Comanche 3
          - Death Rally
          - DooM, DooM ][
          - Gabriel Knight (VGA)
          - Heretic
          - Hexen
          - Pandora Directive (may require new VDMA)
          - Psycho Pinball
          - Raptor
          - Sam'n Max (gets fixed by COMPATIBILITY_DPMI)
          - Strife
          - Syndicate Wars
          - Under a Killing Moon (may require new VDMA)

         It will also make some games to work "a bit more". This means that
          they may crash, but it's not the fault of Anti-CLI, but another bug.
          - Broken Sword
          - Gabriel Knight (VESA)
          - Gabriel Knight 2
          - Leisure Suit Larry 7
          - UFO: Apocalypse

  ====================
  | vCOMPAT GOSIERRA |
  ====================

         From 0.34+, vCOMPAT also implements GOSIERRA patching. This will make
          the following games work without any prior manual patching or
          changing sounddrivers, so actually letting people run those games
          directly from CD-ROM. Please note that vCOMPAT is removing bad code,
          that is not able to work on faster computers. For more information
          please read "gosierra.txt". This code was derived from the GOSIERRAv3
          tool, that is currently available from various sources.

         I even improved the patches, because the previously ones had problems,
          when running in inaccurate DOS machines (e.g. Windows) and/or
          inaccurate virtual Soundblaster emulation.

          Please note that this feature is only available, when vSOUND is
           loaded as well!

          This feature will fix at least the following games. They are now 100%
           playable from original unmodified CD-ROMs.

                      done by IBM in their latest kernels (INT25h is supposed
                      to be buggy, this bug was fixed by IBM, we are emulating
                      it again)
        v0.23b - [+] COMPATIBILITY_CDAUDIO got renamed into COMPATIBILITY_CDROM
                      It includes all CD-ROM specific fixes and a new one, that
                      caused some installation software to believe that A:
                      would be a CD-ROM

                      related patches, which will safe realmode-memory)
                 [+] Reworked the realmode injector, uses VDD-space now and
                      much less V86 memory now
        v0.33b - [+] Magical VM Patcher also removes Clipper Timer-Unit bugs
                      Resulting in "division by zero" messages
        v0.34b - [+] Improved magical VM patch data (internal change)
                 [-] Anti-CLI code now doesn't ring-0 trap anymore, if
                      application sets a guard page in a memory block
                      (experienced, when using Anti-CLI on Quake)
                 [-] Theoretical stack corruption in INT 21h PREHOOK fixed
                 [+] Implemented GoSierra patching into vCOMPAT
                      ONLY AVAILABLE, WHEN vSOUND is also loaded!
                      (removes sounddriver bugs from 99% of all Sierra On-Line
                       real mode games on-the-fly)
