  ============
  | FOREWORD |
  ============

        OS/2 / eComStation's VDM is nearly perfectly emulating a real DOS
         session. Did I say nearly? Yes, I did.

        The CMOS in standard PCs has a data area, that contains the basic
         configuration of the computer like harddrive settings and so on.

        For this area a virtual device driver is available from IBM, but the
         driver allows VDM applications to *write* to that area without any
         user notification. Also the CMOS realtime interrupt (IRQ8) is not
         virtualized, so applications that need that IRQ will mostly get stuck
         and won't work.

        That's why I wrote a replacement driver for the VDD. The basic
         operation was just easy and was done within minutes. My replacement
         allows the user to choose wether to allow applications to access the
         CMOS data area or to write-protect it (the latter one is default).
         Also the CMOS realtime interrupt is now virtualized.

  ======================
  | vCMOS INSTALLATION |
  ======================

        Simply rename the original vCMOS.SYS in your MDOS directory
         (e.g. x:\OS2\MDOS) and replace the vCMOS.SYS contained in
         this package with it.

        Do *NOT* modify your config.sys, because that driver is automatically
         loaded by OS/2 / eComStation. It has *NOT* to be listed in config.sys.

        For the CMOS-RTC interrupt, you WILL need the latest HRTX driver
         installed to your system. It's a replacement for the TIMER0.SYS driver
         from IBM. If you don't have it installed, vCMOS will still work, but
         no interrupt virtualization will be done.

  ====================
  | vCMOS PROPERTIES |
  ====================

        CMOS_WRITE_PROTECTION (default ON):
       -------------------------------------
         If enabled, vCMOS will only allow VDM applications to access the data
          that is stored in the CMOS data area. It will deny any writes. Some
          software could require this protection to get removed, but most
          should run fine with the protection switched on.

         Note that CMOS-RTC registers are *ALWAYS* virtualized. No physical
          access is possible at all on those.

        CMOS_INTERRUPT (default ON):
       ------------------------------
         If enabled, vCMOS will generate RTC-IRQs (IRQ8), if requested by VDM
          applications. This is the best setting, because of performance and
          compatibility reasons.

         If set to "ALWAYS", IRQ8 will get emulated in every VDM *even* if the
          application does not need it. Use this feature with care!

         This will feature will only work, when the latest HRTX
          (high resolution timer) is installed on the system. Otherwise the
          property will report this problem and the feature will not be
          available.

         This virtualization will fix at least the game "Archon".

  | GREETZ AND DEDICATIONS |
  ==========================

        I'm dedicating vCMOS to Gerd Kiewitz, my daddy.

        I want to thank IBM for the great operating system called OS/2 and
         Serenity Systems for releasing eComStation.

        Special greetings go to Armin Sch„fer.
