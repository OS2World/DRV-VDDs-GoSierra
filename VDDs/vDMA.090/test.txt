Emulation Methods used by VDM:
-------------------------------
   Single-Init Mode:
  ===================
   On fresh transfers, the first few bytes (1k) will get copied over, then the
   transfer will get started. Afterwards the remaining bytes will get copied as
   well.

   If we detect DMA-CurLength Peeks...
    [                                  ]
    [   |                              ]
    [       |                          ] - Rape-Fill detected so copy:
    [        xxxxxx                    ]    (from current pos 1 1/2 of last
                                             distance)
    [           |                      ]
    [            xxxxxx                ]

    [               |                  ]
    [                xxxxxx            ]

   Auto-Init Mode:
  =================
   First of all, we will copy the whole current buffer over and kick-start it
    afterwards. We will assume that we will get at least 2 VDHCallOutDMA() and
    we split buffer internally (double-buffer technique).

   If we detect DMA-CurLength Peeks, we will wait till we get at least 2 within
    one loop. On the 2nd, we will copy data from CopyPos till LastGotPos,
    effectively copying application assumed processed data.

   After switching to Rape-Fill, we will stay there till the transfer gets
    stopped by the application.
