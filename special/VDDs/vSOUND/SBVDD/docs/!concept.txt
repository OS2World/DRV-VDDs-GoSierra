First concepts:
================

/***ET+ CRF - Client Register Frame
 *
 *      The EBX register points to the CRF structure on entry
 *      to I/O port handlers and VDD interrupt handlers.  VDDs
 *      can retrieve or modify the client's registers with this
 *      interface.
 */


DMA-Playback:
==============
   GetDMAbuffer & Copy to free internal VDD buffer
   If bufferPlaying & IRQ not raised -> StopStream
   Queue Buffer

Callback from DTA - PreAck:
============================
   SetHook to get into VDM context
   InContext -> Raise VIRQ
                Set RaisedVIRQ for CurPlay Buffer

EOI-Hook:
==========
   Clear VIRQ

IRET-EOI-hook:
===============
   If Auto-Init -> call DMA-Playback

DMA-Hook:
==========
Setzt UsedDMA-Channel

Detection-IRQ-Release:
=======================
 Detection is detected due checking DMA-buffer length <512 bytes or via
  Function F2 on Soundblaster.
 Due the "great" programming skills of some game programmers ;) we need to
  release multiple IRQs, just to be sure one goes through.
  First: Directly after request
  Second: When any soundblaster port is read 10 times within 5 ms, *BUT* no
           write was performed on any port, we release another one.
           (stupid, but this has to be done)
           -> so even Sierra games without GoSierra don't work, grrrrr. But
               it's not possible :(
