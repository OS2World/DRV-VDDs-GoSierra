SB-VDD is a Virtual Soundblaster Driver for OS/2 / eCS
=======================================================

Written by Martin Kiewitz, all rights reserved.

This documentation contains all the specials of this VDD.
Not everything can be emulated for 100%, but I believe I got most of all right.

For ease of use, this VDD is *hard-coded* to Port 220h-22Fh, IRQ 5 and DMA 1/5.
 This can *NOT* be changed, because most games expect the hardware at that
 location. If the VDM isn't starting up after installing this driver, then it
 could mean that you already got another VDD that uses the same ports/IRQ.
 Simply remove it.

A special-thing to detect the emulation of this VDD is to request the version
 number via SB-Command E1h. First the SB-version will be replied as 2 bytes.
 After that the magics 77d and 75d. In ASCII notation this means MK.

HW_SOUND defines copyright

HW_SOUND_PASSTHRU defines, if VSOUND is supposed to pass through all
 soundblaster commands to a real Soundblaster existing on port 220h. IRQ may
 be different, but vSOUND will emulate in any case detection IRQs via IRQ5.

HW_SOUND_TYPE defines, what type of Soundblaster gets emulated
 Possible choices are "Soundblaster 16", "Soundblaster PRO", "Soundblaster" and
  "None". Note: This does not change actual emulation, so 16-bit stereo is
  available at any time. It only affects version number of returned hardware.

HW_SOUND_MIXER defines, if a VDM application is allowed to change volume/treble
 settings on the real soundcard.

Connection to vCOMPAT at init time:
Detection of DMA transfer (1 byte size) -> trigger to vCOMPAT
 -> Send ClientRegisterFrame to vCOMPAT
 -> vCOMPAT will then match MagicalVMPatcher signatures onto current CS
 -> Now process I/O command

Also patch out Dynamix IRQ restore bug (same detection):
