  ============
  | FOREWORD |
  ============

        OS/2 / eComStation's VDM is nearly perfectly emulating a real DOS
         session. Did I say nearly? Yes, I did.

        The VCDROM driver has some really bad bugs, incompatibility issues and
         also traps the system every now and then (due bad pointer handling).

        That's why I wrote a replacement driver for this VDD. It includes all
         the fixes from vCOMPAT. It also won't trap and it's checking
         input/output buffers for segment overflows. Another feature is the
         automatic unlocking. Previously if a VDM application asked the system
         to lock a CD-ROM drive, it remained locked even if the VDM was closed.
         That's not the case with my replacement anymore. It also includes a
         work-around for a bug in OS2CDROM.DMD/CD-ROM IFS that doesnt allow
         getting handles to a drive, if no CD is inserted (also denying any
         device status calls, etc.). This is a 100% rebuild, not one line of
         code from the old driver got used and it's 95% assembly. It's larger
         than the original version, because I implemented much more stuff and
         didn't do some pseudo-optimizations like that pointer mishandling.

        Original vCDROM reacted on INT_DURING_IO. I'm not doing so, because
         vPIC contains a bug that will never reply any errors to the caller
         when doing device I/O via slave-thread. Such error-codes could affect
         copy-protections or multimedia applications that read directly from
         CD-ROM.

        There is also another problem that affected original vCDROM. Some OS/2
         driver contains a bug (OS2CDROM or IFS, I don't know for sure) that
         will deny opening a CD-ROM drive, when no CD-ROM is inserted. This
         resulted in an unpredictable mess especially with Device-Status,
         because that IOCTL should work at any time. I'm using fixed values, if
         the open failed, so VDM applications will at least get something that
         looks correctly.

  =======================
  | vCDROM INSTALLATION |
  =======================

        Simply rename the original vCDROM.SYS in your MDOS directory
         (e.g. x:\OS2\MDOS) and replace the vCDROM.SYS contained in
         this package with it.

        A line containing "DEVICE=x:\OS2\MDOS\VCDROM.sys" should be already in
         your config.sys, so don't add it again. If the driver is successfully
         loaded, it will generate a property called "CDROM" containg copyright.

        If you use vCOMPAT, you should update to 0.32b+. From that version on,
         vCOMPAT will detect the vCDROM replacement and remove most of the
         compatibility fixes automatically (ffs. vcompat.txt).

  =====================
  | vCDROM PROPERTIES |
  =====================

        INT_DURING_CDROM:
       -------------------
         If enabled, the VDM will still receive interrupts during CD-ROM
          absolute disc reads. Otherwise it will block till the call is done.
          It will default to OFF, because activating this functionality will
          disable error-trapping and every call will succeed, which could cause
          problems. This bug is in vPIC, not in vCDROM.

  | GREETZ AND DEDICATIONS |
  ==========================

        I'm dedicating vCDROM to Gerd Kiewitz, my daddy.

        I want to thank IBM for the great operating system called OS/2 and
         Serenity Systems for releasing eComStation.

        Special greetings go to the developer that did this:
         *((PULONG)(control_block_pointer-3)) = '10DC';
