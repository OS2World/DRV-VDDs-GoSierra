  | FOREWORD |
  ============

        Well, at the location that I work at, we are using a system for DNA
         analysis. This is working on a DOS/Windows 3.11 environment and is
         using a parallel port dongle. This system broke several times, but I
         was able to fix it. I thought about that dongle breaking and so I did
         a vLPT replacement, that is able to emulate (at least) this dongle.

        The original vLPT from IBM was not really a virtualization driver. It
         simply checked, if full hardware access could be granted and then gave
         this to the VDM application. This is of course not the best solution,
         because newer parallel ports are able to be interrupt driven and most
         DOS software uses them in polling mode, which wastes many CPU cycles.

        My VDD actually simulates a parallel port to the DOS application and so
         it's even possible to reroute parallel traffic to USB devices, reroute
         it to actual files or even making a DOS program indirectly use ECP/EPP
         for communication to a printer.

  =============
  | IMPORTANT |
  =============

        This driver is definitely in public *BETA* state. Do NOT use it in
         productive environments.

  =====================
  | VDMA INSTALLATION |
  =====================

        Simply replace \OS2\MDOS\VLPT.SYS with the supplied version.
         Please *DO* make a backup copy of the original driver, so you can
         restore it, if my replacement doesn't work correctly.

        YOU DO NOT HAVE TO MODIFY YOUR CONFIG.SYS. VLPT IS LOADED AUTOMATICALLY
         BY OS/2.

  | GREETZ AND DEDICATIONS |
  ==========================

        I'm dedicating VLPT to Gerd Kiewitz, my daddy.

        I want to thank IBM for the great operating system called OS/2 and
         Serenity Systems for releasing eComStation.
